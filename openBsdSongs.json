To do great things, we must reach for\nthe sky.  Sometimes we fail, and quite often it is messy.\n\nThere is of course a danger we'll believe we are invincible, and push\na change which is too disruptive to others.  For that reason, we\noperate as a team.

distributions for the\nO'Reilly book \"Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution\".\nWe recommend you read his story, entitled\n\n\"Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix\nFrom AT&T-Owned to Freely Redistributable\"\nfirst, to see how Kirk remembers how we got here.\nSadly, since it showed up in book form originally, this text has\nprobably not been read by enough people.\n\nThe USL(AT&T) vs BSDI/UCB court case settlement documents were\nnot public until recently; their disclosure has made the facts more clear.\nBut the story of how three people decided to free the BSD codebase\nof corporate pollution \u2014 and release it freely \u2014 is more interesting\nthan the lawsuit which followed.  Sure, a stupid lawsuit happened which\nhindered the acceptance of the BSD code during a critical period.\nBut how did a bunch of guys go through the effort of replacing so\nmuch AT&T code in the first place? After all, companies had\nlots of really evil lawyers back then too \u2014 were they not afraid?\n\nAfter a decade of development, most of the AT&T code had\nalready been replaced by university researchers and their associates.\nSo Keith Bostic, Mike Karels and Kirk McKusick (the main UCB CSRG group)\nstarted going through the 4.3BSD codebase to cleanse the rest.\nKeith, in particular, built a ragtag team (in those days, USENIX\nconferences were a gold mine for such team building) and led these\nrebels to rewrite and replace all the Imperial AT&T code, piece by\npiece, starting with the libraries and userland programs.\nAnyone who helped only got credit as a Contributor \u2014 people like\nChris Torek and a cast of .. hundreds more.\n\nThen Mike and Kirk purified the kernel. After a bit more careful\nchecking, this led to the release of a clean tree called Net/2 which\nwas given to the world in June 1991 \u2014 the largest dump of free source\ncode the world had ever received (for those days \u2014 not modern monsters like OpenOffice).\n\nSome of these ragtags formed a company (BSDi) to sell a production system\nbased on this free code base, and a year later Unix System Laboratories\n(basically AT&T) sued BSDi and UCB.\nEventually AT&T lost and after a few trifling fixes (described in the\nlawsuit documents) the codebase was free.  A few newer developments\n(and more free code) were added, and released in June 1994 as 4.4BSD-Lite.\nJust over 14 years later OpenBSD is releasing its own 4.4 release (and for\na lot less than $1000 per copy).\n\nThe OpenBSD 4.4 release is dedicated to Keith Bostic, Mike Karels, Kirk McKusick,\nand all of those who contributed to making Net/2 and 4.4BSD-Lite free.", "lyrics": "Source Wars\nEpisode IV\nTrial of the BSD Knights\n\nNot so very long ago\nand not so far away\nAT&T made system code\nand gave some bits away\n\nSome Berkeley geeks rebuilt it\nbetter, faster, more diverse\nThis open thing was wonderful\nfor everyone on Earth\n\nAnd then the roaring 90's came\nThe Empire changed its mind\nAnd good old greed was back again\nThe geeks were in a legal bind\n\nThe Empire's Unix Lab\nsued BSDi from above\nThe code is free but\nonly we can sell it bub!\n\nThe University came calling\nin full protective mode\nand proved the source in Net/2\ndidn't use the Empire's code\n\nThen Bostic brought the Empire's books\nn' slammed them dandys down\nAnd showed the giant chunks\nof BSD code all around\n\nThey didn't even give an ounce\nof credit front to back\nThis broke the license USL\nwas using to attack\n\nThe case was thrown out by the judge\nand \"settled\" out of court\nAnd UCB was big enough\nto take it like a sport\n\nAnd to this day the geekfolk say\nNow did we win or lose?\nThey shoulda made 'em reprint\nevery book with proper dues\n\nAnd take out ads in major rags\napologetically\nAnd maybe now it wouldn't be\nthe same monopoly\n\nThe Empire might have tumbled\ndown if everybody saw\nHow greed became so big\nthey couldn't see that glaring flaw\n\nBut only one community\nthe one that makes it tick\nIs there to fight for everyone\nexposing hypocrites\n\nAnd OpenBSD is here\nto tell the story right\nOnce again the fight is fought\nand kept in shining light\n\nAnd may the source be with you\nMay the Empire fall apart\nYa like that's gonna happen!\nBut we gotta keep heart!"}, {"version": "4.3", "title": " \"Home to Hypocrisy\"", "mp3": "https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/songs/song43.mp3", "image": "https://www.openbsd.org/images/43song.gif", "info": "We are just plain tired of being lectured to by a man\nwho is a lot like\nNaomi Campbell.\n\nIn 1998 when a United Airlines plane was waiting in the queue at\nWashington Dulles International Airport for take-off to New Orleans\n(where a Usenix conference was taking place), one man stood up from\nhis seat, demanded that they stop waiting in the queue and be permitted\nto deplane.  Even after orders from the crew and a pilot from\nthe cockpit he refused to sit down.  The plane exited the queue\nand returned to the airport gangway.  Security personnel ran onto\nthe plane and removed this man, Richard Stallman, from the plane.\nAfter Richard was removed from the plane, everyone else stayed\nonboard and continued their journey to New Orleans.  A few\nOpenBSD developers were on that same plane, seated very close by,\nso we have an accurate story of the events.\n\nThis is the man who presumes that he should preach to us\nabout morality, freedom, and what is best for us.  He believes\nit is his God-given role to tell us what is best for us, when he\nhas shown that he takes actions which are not best for everyone.\nHe prefers actions which he thinks are best for him \u2014 and him\nalone \u2014 and then lies to the public.  Richard Stallman is no Spock.\n\nWe release our software in ways that are maximally free.  We\nremove all restrictions on use and distribution, but leave a\nrequirement to be known as the authors.  We follow a pattern of\nfree source code distribution that started in the mid-1980's\nin Berkeley, from before Richard Stallman had any powerful\ninfluence which he could use so falsely.\n\nWe have a development sub-tree called \"ports\".  Our \"ports\" tree\nbuilds software that is 'found on the net' into packages that\nOpenBSD users can use more easily.  A scaffold of Makefiles and\nscripts automatically fetch these pieces of software, apply\npatches as required by OpenBSD, and then build them into nice\nneat little tarballs.  This is provided as a convenience for\nusers. The ports tree is maintained by OpenBSD entirely separately\nfrom our main source tree.  Some of the software which is fetched\nand compiled is not as free as we would like, but what can we do.\nAll the other operating system projects make exactly the same\ndecision, and provide these same conveniences to their users.\n\nRichard felt that this \"ports tree\" of ours made OpenBSD non-free.\nHe came to our mailing lists and lectured to us specifically, yet\nhe said nothing to the many other vendors who do the same; many of\nthem donate to the FSF and perhaps that has something to do with it.\nMeanwhile, Richard has personally made sure that all the official\nGNU software \u2014 including Emacs \u2014 compiles and runs on Windows.\n\nThat man is a false leader.

Many other projects purport to share\nthese same goals, and love to wrap themselves in a banner of \"Open\nSource\" and \"Free Software\".  Given how many projects there are one\nwould think it might be easy to stick to those goals, but it doesn't\nseem to work out that way.  A variety of desires drag many projects\naway from the ideals very quickly.\n\nMuch of any operating system's usability depends on device support,\nand there are some very tempting alternative ways to support devices\navailable to those who will surrender their moral code.  A project\ncould compromise by entering into NDA agreements with vendors, or\nincluding binary objects in the operating system for which no source\ncode exists, or tying their users down with contract terms hidden\ninside copyright notices.  All of these choices surrender some subset\nof the ideals, and we simply will not do this.  Sure, we care about\ngetting devices working, but not at the expense of our original goals.\n\nOf course since \"free to share with anyone\" is part of our goals,\nwe've been at the forefront of many licensing and NDA issues,\nresulting in a good number of successes.  This success had led to much\nrecognition for the advancement of Free Software causes, but has also\nled to other issues.\n\nWe fully admit that some BSD licensed software has been taken and used\nby many commercial entities, but contributions come back more often\nthan people seem to know, and when they do, they're always still\nproperly attributed to the original authors, and given back in the\nsame spirit that they were given in the first place.\n\nThat's the best we can expect from companies.  After all, we make our\nstuff so free so that everyone can benefit \u2014 it remains a core goal;\nwe really have not strayed at all in 10 years.  But we can expect more\nfrom projects who talk about sharing \u2014 such as the various Linux\nprojects.\n\nNow rather than seeing us as friends who can cooperatively improve all\ncodebases, we are seen as foes who oppose the GPL.  The participants\nof \"the race\" are being manipulated by the FSF and their legal arm, the\nSFLC, for the FSF's aims, rather than the goal of getting good source\ninto Linux (and all other code bases).  We don't want this to come off\nas some conspiracy theory, but we simply urge those developers caution\n\u2014 they should ensure that the path they are being shown by those who\nhave positioned themselves as leaders is still true.

No matter how nice an operating system is, it remains\nuseless and unusable without solid support for a wide percentage of the\nhardware that is available on the market.  It is therefore rather unsurprising\nthat more than half of our efforts focus on various aspects relating to\ndevice support.\n\nMost parts of the operating system (from low kernel, through to libraries,\nall the way up to X, and then even to applications) use fairly obvious\ninterface layers, where the \"communication protocols\" or \"argument passing\"\nmechanisms (ie. APIs) can be understood by any developer who takes the\ntime to read the free code.  Device drivers pose an additional and significant\nchallenge though: because many vendors refuse to document the exact behavior\nof their devices.  The devices are black boxes.  And often they are surprisingly\nweird, or even buggy.\n\nWhen vendor documentation does not exist, the development process can\nbecome extremely hairy.  Groups of developers have found themselves focused\nfor months at a time, figuring out the most simple steps, simply because\nthe hardware is a complete mystery.  Access to documentation can ease\nthese difficulties rapidly.  However, getting access to the chip documentation\nfrom vendors is ... almost always a negotiation.  If we had open access to\ndocumentation, anyone would be able to see how simple all these devices\nactually are, and device driver development would flourish (and not just in\nOpenBSD, either).\n\nWhen we proceed into negotiations with vendors, asking for documentation,\nour position is often weak.  One would assume that the modern market is fair,\nand that selling chips would be the primary focus of these vendors.  But\nunfortunately a number of behemoth software vendors have spent the last 10 or\n20 years building\n\npolitical hurdles against the smaller players.\n\nA particularly nasty player in this regard has been the Linux vendors and\nsome Linux developers, who have played along with an American corporate model\nof requiring NDAs for chip documentation.  This has effectively put Linux\ninto the club with Microsoft, but has left all the other operating system\ncommunities \u2014 and their developers \u2014 with much less available clout for\nrequesting documentation.  In a more fair world, the Linux vendors would\nwork with us, and the device driver support in all free operating systems\nwould be fantastic by now.\n\nWe only ask that\n\nusers help us in changing the political landscape.", "lyrics": "Here's an old story ...\n\n\nPuffy Baba and the 40 Vendors\nWe all know the details\nMagic cave, magic words, some thieves,\nsome serious loot,\nand lucky \u2014 Mister \u2014 Baba\nWho got a bad rap if you ask me\nThe little guy who\ndid the best with what he had\n\n\nHere are Mr. Baba's lessons\nLoad one ass, take a few trips and spend\nin moderation\nThree things the average man can't \u2014 get \u2014 right\n\n\nIf you know your brother is a greedy bastard\nnever give him the password\nIf he goes penguin on you,\nstop \u2014 being \u2014 his brother.\nWhen a cave is guarded by magic lawyers\nA sea of blood will be its doormat\nSo do the best with what you have\n\n\nBeyond the lessons \u2014 you must know this\nthat the Devil is as real as your address\nBut unlike Vendors,\nhe at least keeps the door open\n\n\nVendors of water that should be free\nLook upon their words and despair\nTheir badvertising made a thief of my brother\nthen made him better off dead\nNow he hasn't got shit to do his best with\n\n\nGratis.

Before the 3.7 release we disabled support\nfor the\naac(4)\nAdaptec RAID driver because negotiations with the Adaptec had failed.\nThey refused to give us documentation.  Without documentation, support\nfor their controller had always been poor.  The driver had bugs (which\naffected some users more than others) which caused crashes, and of\ncourse there was no RAID management support.  Apparently most of these\nbugs are because the Adaptec controllers have numerous buggy firmware\nissues which require careful workarounds; without documentation we\ncannot solve these issues.\n\nThe driver was written by an OpenBSD developer, who cribbed parts\nof it from a FreeBSD driver written by an ex-Adaptec employee.  But no\npublic documentation exists, and Adaptec has dozens of cards with\ndifferent firmware issues. All of this adds up to a very desperate\ndevelopment model \u2014 it becomes very hard for the principle of\n\"quality\" to show its head.\n\nRAID devices have two main qualities that people buy them for:\n\nRedundancy\nRepair\n\n\nYou want a RAID unit to provide you with redundancy, so that if some drives\nfail, your data is not lost.  But once a drive has failed, you require your\narray to (automatically, most likely) perform the operations to repair\nitself, so that it is functioning perfectly again.\n\nSome vendors (or like the above Adaptec case, ex-employee) have\nsometimes given us some documentation so that we could write drivers,\nso that their devices could support Redundancy.  But these vendors have\nnever given us any documentation for performing Repairs.\n\nInstead these vendors have tried to pass out non-free RAID management\ntools.  These are typically gigantic Linux binaries, or some crazy thing, that\nis supposed to work through a bizarre interface in the device driver, which\nwe are apparently supposed to write code for without any documentation.\n\nAnd since we refuse to accept our users being forced into depending on\nvendor binaries, we have reverse engineered the management interface for\nthe AMI controllers.\n\nThere is no great \"intellectual property\" in this stuff, it is all\nrather simple primitives.  This is all that we need to implement\nbasic RAID management:\n\nSCSI transactions on the back-side busses\nDiscovering which drives are in which volumes\nBeing able to silence the buzzer\nMarking a new drive as a Hot-Spare\n\n\nThe AMI driver needed to support these small primitive operations.\nAnd once we had that, we rely on something else which we know: Almost\nall the RAID controllers would need the same primitives.\n\nThus armed, we were able to write a generic framework which would later\nwork on other vendors' RAID cards, that is, once we get documentation\nor do some reverse engineering for their products.\n\nBut having been ignored for so long by these vendors, it is not clear when (if\never) we will get around to writing that support for Adaptec RAID\ncontrollers now.  And Adaptec has gone and bought ICP Vortex, which\nmay mean we can never get documentation for the\ngdt(4)\ncontrollers.\nThe \"Open Source Friendly liar\" IBM owns Mylex, and Mylex has told us we\nwould not get documentation, either.\n3Ware has lied to us and our users so many times they make politicians\nlook saintly.\n\nUntil other vendors give us documentation, if you want reliable RAID\nin OpenBSD, please buy\nLSI/AMI RAID cards.

Many vendors refused to supply\nprogrammers with programming documentation for these chipsets.  Donald\nBecker (Linux) and Bill Paul (FreeBSD) changed the rules of the game\nhere: They wrote drivers for the chipsets that they could get\ndocumentation for, and as they succeeded in writing more and more\ndrivers, eventually closed vendors slowly opened up until most\nethernet chipset documentation was available.  Today, some vendors\nstill resist releasing ethernet chipset documentation (ie. Broadcom,\nIntel, Marvell/SysKonnect, NVIDIA) but the driver problem is mostly\nsolved in the ethernet market.\n\nSimilar problems have happened in the SCSI, IDE, and RAID markets.\nAgain, the problem was solved by writing drivers for documented\ndevices first. If the free software user communities use those drivers\npreferentially, it is a market loss for the secretive vendors.\nAnother approach that has worked is to publish email addresses and\nphone numbers for the marketing department managers in these\ncompanies.  These email campaigns have worked almost every time.\n\nThe new frontier: 802.11 wireless chipsets.\n\nOver the last six months, this came to a head in the OpenBSD project.\nWe asked our users to help us petition numerous vendors so that we\ncould get chipset documentation or redistributable firmware.  Certainly, we did\nnot succeed for some vendors.  But we did influence some vendors, in\nparticular the Taiwanese (Ralink and Realtek), who have given us\neverything we need.  We also reverse engineered the Atheros chipsets.\n\nWant to help us?  Avoid\nIntel Centrino,\nBroadcom, TI, or Connexant PrismGT chipsets.\nHeck, avoid buying even regular\nold pre-G Prism products,\nto send a message.\nIf you can, buy 802.11 products using chips by\nRealtek,\nRalink,\nAtmel,\nADMTek,\nAtheros.\nOur manual pages attempt to explain which vendors (ie. D-Link) box\nwhich chipsets into which product.\n\nSend a message that open support for hardware matters.  A vendor in\nRedmond largely continues their practices because they get\nthe chipset documentation years before everyone else does.\nWhat really upsets us the most is that some Linux vendors are signing\nNon-Disclosure Agreements with vendors, or contracts that let them\ndistribute firmwares.

Few things could be considered as humorous as making a\nredundancy protocol... redundant; e.g. being forced to replace it by\nCisco lawyers and IETF policy.\n\nWe've been working a few years now on our packet filtering software\npf(4)\nand it became time to add failover.  We want to be able to set up pf\nfirewalls side by side, and exchange the stateful information between\nthem, so that in case of failure another could take over 'keep state'\nsessions.  Our\npfsync(4)\nprotocol solves this problem.  However, on both sides of the firewall,\nit is also necessary to have all the regular hosts not see a\nnetwork failure.  The only reliable way to do this is for both\nfirewall machines to have and use the same IP and MAC addresses.  But\nthe only real way to do that is to use multicast protocols.\n\nThe IETF community proposed work in this direction in the late\n90's, however in 1997 Cisco informed them that they believed some of\nCisco's patents covered the proposed IETF VRRP (Virtual Router\nRedundancy Protocol); on\n\nMarch 20, 1998 they went further and specifically named their HSRP\n\"Hot Standby Router Protocol\" patent.  Reputedly, they were upset\nthat IETF had not simply adopted the flawed HSRP protocol as the\nstandard solution for this problem.  Despite this legal pressure, the\nIETF community forged ahead and published VRRP as a standard even\nthough there was a patent in the space.  Why?\n\nThere was much deliberation\nat all levels of the IETF, and unfortunately for all of us the\npoliticians within eventually decided to allow patented technology in\nstandards \u2014 as long as the patented technology is licensed under RAND\n(Reasonable And Non Discriminatory) terms.  As free software\nprogrammers, we therefore find ourselves in the position that these\nRAND standards must not be implemented by us, and we must deviate from\nthe standard.  We find all this rather Unreasonable and Discriminatory\nand we *will* design competing protocols.  Some standards organization,\neh?\n\nDue to some HSRP flaws fixed by VRRP and for compatibility with the\n(HSRP-licensed) VRRP implementations of their competitors, Cisco in\nrecent times has largely abandoned HSRP and now relies on VRRP instead\n\u2014 a protocol designed for and by the community, but for which they\nclaim patent rights.\n\nOn August 7 2002, after many communications, Robert Barr (Cisco's\nlawyer) firmly informed the OpenBSD community that Cisco would defend\nits patents for VRRP implementations \u2014 meaning basically that it was\nimpossible for a free software group to produce a truly free\nimplementation of the IETF standard protocol.  Perhaps this is because\nCisco and Alcatel are currently engaged in a pair of patent lawsuits; a\nsmall piece of which is Cisco attempting to use the HSRP patent\nagainst Alcatel for their use of VRRP.  Some IETF working group\nmembers took note of our complaints,\n\nhowever an attempt in April 2003 to have the IETF abandon the use of\npatented technology failed to \"reach consensus\" in the IETF.\n\nA few years ago, the W3C, who designs our web protocols, tried to move\nto a RAND policy as well (primarily because of pressure from Microsoft\nand Apple), but the community outrage was so overpowering that they\nbacked down.  Some standards groups use this policy, while others\navoid it \u2014 the one differentiation being the amount of corporate\nparticipation. In the IETF, the pro-RAND agents work for AT&T,\nAlcatel, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, and other large companies.  Since IETF\nis an open forum, they can blend in as the populace, and vote just\nlike all others, except against the community.\n\nTranslation: In failing to \"reach consensus\", the companies who\nbenefit from RAND won, and the community lost again.\n\nLeft with little choice, we proceeded to reinvent the wheel or, more\ncorrectly, abandon the wheel entirely and go for a \"hovercraft\".  We\ndesigned CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol) to solve the same\nproblem that these other protocols are designed for, but without the\nsame technological basis as HSRP and VRRP.  We read the patent\ndocument carefully and ensured that CARP was fundamentally different.\nWe also avoided many of the flaws in HSRP and VRRP (such as an inherent\nlack of security).  And since we are OpenBSD developers, we designed\nit to use cryptography.\n\nThe combination of\npf(4),\npfsync(4), and\ncarp(4)\nhas permitted us to build highly redundant firewalls.  To date, we\nhave built a few networks that include as many as 4 firewalls, all\nrunning random reboot cycles.  As long as one firewall is alive in a\ngroup, traffic through them moves smoothly and correctly for all of\nour packet filter functionality.  Cisco's low end products are unable\nto do this reliably, and if they have high end products which can do\nthis, you most certainly cannot afford them.\n\nAs a final note of course, when we petitioned IANA, the IETF body\nregulating \"official\" internet protocol numbers, to give us numbers\nfor CARP and pfsync our request was denied.  Apparently we had failed\nto go through an official standards organization.  Consequently we\nwere forced to choose a protocol number which would not conflict with\nanything else of value, and decided to place CARP at IP protocol 112.\nWe also placed pfsync at an open and unused number. We informed IANA of\nthese decisions, but they declined to reply.\n\nThis ridiculous situation then inspired one of our developers to create\nthis parody of the well-known Monty Python skit and song.", "lyrics": "Customer:\n\nHello, I would like to buy a CARP license please.\n\nLicenser:\n\nA what?\nCustomer:\n\nA license for my network redundancy protocol, CARP.\nLicenser:\n\nWell, it's free isn't it?\nCustomer:\n\nExactly, the protocol's name is CARP.  CARP the redundancy protocol.\nLicenser:\n\nWhat?\nCustomer:\n\nHe is an.... redundancy protocol.\nLicenser:\n\nCARP is a free redundancy protocol!\nCustomer:\n\nYes, I chose it out of three, I didn't like the others,\nthey were all too... encumbered.  And now I must license it!\nLicenser:\n\nYou must be a looney.\nCustomer:\n\nI am not a looney!  Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely\nbecause I wish to protect my redundancy protocol?  I've heard tell\nthat Network Associates has a pet algorithm called RSA used in IETF\nstandards, and you wouldn't call them a looney; Geoworks has a claim\non WAP, after what their lawyers do to you if you try to implement it.\nCisco has two redundant patents, both encumbered, and Cadtrack has a\npatent on cursor movement!

It can't be called VRRP without it.\nLicenser:\n\nThere's no such thing as a bloody VRRP license.\nCustomer:\n\nYes there is!\nLicenser:\n\nIsn't!\nCustomer:\n\nIs!\nLicenser:\n\nIsn't!\nCustomer:\n\nI bleeding got one, look!

I'm very observant!  I never seen\nso many bleeding aerials.  The man said that their equipment could\npinpoint a failover configuration at 400 yards!  And my Cisco router,\nbeing such a flappy bat, was a piece of cake.\nLicenser:\n\nHow much did you pay for that?\nCustomer:\n\nSixty quid, and twenty grand for the PIX.\nLicenser:\n\nWhat PIX?\nCustomer:\n\nThe PIX I'm replacing!\nLicenser:\n\nSo you're replacing your PIX with free software, and yet you want to\nlicense it?\nCustomer:\n\nThere's nothing so odd about that. I'm sure they patented this\nprotocol too.  After all, the IETF had a hand in it!\nLicenser:\n\nNo they didn't!\nCustomer:\n\nDid!\nLicenser:\n\nDidn't!\nCustomer:\n\nDid, did, did and did!\nLicenser:\n\nOh, all right.\nCustomer:\n\nSpoken like a gentleman, sir.

It had an accident.\nLicenser:\n\nYou're off your chump.\nCustomer:\n\nLook, if you intend by that utilization of an obscure colloquialism\nto imply that my sanity is not entirely up to scratch, or indeed to deny the\nsemi-existence of my little half firewall, I shall have to ask you to\nlisten to this!

We provided ideas,\nwrote papers, and deployed cutting-edge technology;\nDARPA provided finances and reaped a share of the\ncredit, and the University of Pennsylvania acted as\na middle-man.  We accepted funding based on the\npromise that our freedom to operate as we wished\nwas unaffected. To us, freedom is more important\nthan funding \u2014 heck, we were dealing with the evil\nforces of government, and needed to be careful.\n\nA few months prior to this release, DARPA suddenly\nand without warning decided to withdraw that funding;\nthey also aggressively backed out of contractual\nobligations.  Many articles in the press followed regarding\nthis sudden maneuver.  Apparently this hoopla happened\nbecause an OpenBSD-related article in the Canadian\nnewspaper The Globe & Mail had quoted Theo de Raadt\nmaking anti-war statements regarding Iraq and the\ntheft of oil.\n\nThe only answer given (to major media reporters) by a\nDARPA spokesperson (Jan Walker) was this:\n\n\"As a result of the DARPA review of the\nproject, and due to world events and the evolving\nthreat posed by increasingly capable nation-states,\nthe Government on April 21 advised the University\nto suspend work on the \"security fest\" portion of\nthe project.\"\n\nThat almost toes the line of calling us terrorists!\nWe had lost financial support, but the release of the\nstatement above suddenly made us very happy to be free\nof any perceived obligation to such crazy people.\n\nSince the termination came near natural contract\ntermination (about 4 months remained), less damage\nthan expected was sustained by the project.  Sponsors\nstepped forward and helped us make up the missing funds\nwe needed to run our \"Hackathon\", and the event\nproceeded as planned.
